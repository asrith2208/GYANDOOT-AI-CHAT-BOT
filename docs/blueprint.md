- Voice Input & Text-to-Speech Output: Allow users to ask questions via voice or text, with answers displayed in text format. A 'Play Voice' button should trigger an audio rendition in the selected language with an emotionally neutral tone.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light saffron (#FFB347), evoking intellect, auspiciousness, and respect.
- Background color: Pale yellow (#FFF8E1), a desaturated version of the primary color, to offer a soft and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FF8A65), which provides warmth and contrast without overpowering the light palette.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for clarity and warmth, making it accessible to users of all ages and tech skill levels.
- Use simple, universally understandable icons to represent different faculties and departments within the university.
- Maintain a clean, uncluttered layout with ample whitespace. Prioritize readability and easy navigation on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Incorporate subtle, unobtrusive animations for feedback and transitions. Animations should enhance usability, not distract from the primary task of information retrieval.
